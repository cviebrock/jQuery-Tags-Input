# Changes

- fixed whitespace and indentation inconsistancies in the Javscript file
- added `tagXChar` option which allows you to set the "x" character on tags, used
  to delete that tag (also updated the default to be the `&times;` character
  instead of a lowercase "x")
- re-minified the Javascript
- converted the CSS to [LESS](http://lesscss.org), and recompiled
